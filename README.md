# Tiffin-service-application-with-laravel
Hello World, This is an online tiffin service application built with laravel 6 and bootstrap 4. In this application, one or more vendors can register as a tiffin service providers. The vendor will have an account panel, where he can manage the tiffin menu with a price. The vendor can view all subscribers. Users can register, login, and subscribe to any of the tiffin services. User can also set the schedule for his/her tiffin. The admin of this application can view vendors, subscribers, and all subscriptions. Admin can set the commission percentage in setting section, So whenever the user subscribes to any vendor then the calculated commission will go to the admin wallet where admin can view his all transactions. In this application, I have added two main important features. One is the stripe payment method and another is mail functionality. Whenever the user will pay then an email will be sent to the connected vendor.
